# Contributing to Vespa
Contributions to [Vespa](http://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa),
[Vespa system tests](http://github.com/vespa-engine/system-test),
[Vespa samples](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps)
and the [Vespa documentation](http://github.com/vespa-engine/documentation) are welcome.
This documents tells you what you need to know to contribute.

## Open development
All work on Vespa happens directly on Github,
using the [Github flow model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
We release the master branch a few times a week and you should expect it to almost always work.
In addition to the [public Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/vespa-engine/vespa) 
we have a large acceptance and performance test suite which
is also run continuously. We plan to add this to the open source code base later.

All pull requests are reviewed by a member of the Vespa Committers team.
You can find a suitable reviewer in the OWNERS file upward in the source tree from
where you are making the change (the OWNERS have a special responsibility for
ensuring the long-term integrity of a portion of the code).
If you want to become a committer/OWNER making some quality contributions is the way to start.


***Creating a Pull Request***

Please follow [best practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices) for creating git commits.

When your code is ready to be submitted,
[submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to begin the code review process.

We only seek to accept code that you are authorized to contribute to the project.
We have added a pull request template on our projects
so that your contributions are made with the following confirmation:

> I confirm that this contribution is made under the terms of the license
> found in the root directory of this repository's source tree
> and that I have the authority necessary to make this contribution on behalf of its copyright owner.

## Versioning
Vespa uses semantic versioning - see
[vespa versions](http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-versions.html).
Notice in particular that any Java API in a package having a @PublicAPI
annotation in the package-info file cannot be changed in an incompatible way
between major versions: Existing types and method signatures must be preserved
(but can be marked deprecated).

## Issues
We track issues in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/issues).
It is fine to submit issues also for feature requests and ideas, whether or not you intend to work on them.

There is also a [ToDo list](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/TODO.md)
for larger things which nobody is working on yet.
