    "content": "My <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-help/\">WP Help</a> plugin just got a huge update. Version 1.0 is really worth checking out. I'm quite proud of it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://markjaquith.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/screen-shot-2012-07-17-at-12-04-21-pm.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-07-17 at 12.04.21 PM\" width=\"584\" height=\"284\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3896\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>WP Help</h3>\r\n\r\nWP Help is a plugin for creating documentation for display within the WordPress admin. Many WordPress installs are customized, and it's really helpful to have a centralized resource for documenting those features. You can create documents about creating content, editing content, moderating comments, or whatever you want! If you have clients who can't seem to remember how to do X, you should install WP Help and document it for them. WP Help is powered by WordPress Custom Post Types, so you create content using the full WordPress editor.\r\n\r\n<h3>Document Syncing</h3>\r\n\r\nOh yeah. This is the feature you've all been waiting for. If you have a standard set of help documents you want to use on multiple sites, this lets you do that. Create the documents, grab the (secret) sync URL for that site, and then plug that URL in to other sites. Those other sites will automatically pull down those documents, and keep them up-to-date (even handling new documents, deleted documents, renamed documents, and re-parented documents). Any internal links in the original document will be rewritten to be local to the destination WP Help install. So go ahead and use the WP internal linking functionality on your source site and know that those links will work on all the destination sites!\r\n\r\n<h3>Menu Placement</h3>\r\n\r\nThe menu item for the help documents can now be placed in one of four locations:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>As a Dashboard submenu</li>\r\n<li>Top level, above the Dashboard</li>\r\n<li>Top level, below the Dashboard</li>\r\n<li>Top level, at the bottom</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nYou get a live preview of this (yeah, I know, super fancy).\r\n\r\n<h3>Menu Name</h3>\r\n\r\nThe menu name (and page title) can be changed. Just doubleclick the page title, edit it, and hit return. Boom. Again, this has a live preview.\r\n\r\n<h3>Topics List Name</h3>\r\n\r\nLikewise the topics list header can be renamed. Doubleclick, edit, return. Live preview.\r\n\r\n<h3>Edit Links &amp; Management Links</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you can edit help documents, you'll get an edit link. When editing, there is a handy \"Manage\" link to jump you back to the documents management interface. Navigating in general has been improved quite a bit.\r\n\r\n<h3>Dashboard Widget</h3>\r\n\r\nThere is now a simple dashboard widget, listing all of your help documents.\r\n\r\n<h3>Better Default Access</h3>\r\n\r\nA lot of you said that you have Contributor-level users who need documentation just like authors do. So now they can view documentation by default (there's a hook if you want to change the capability required to view help documents).\r\n\r\n<h3>Lots of Little Tweaks</h3>\r\n\r\nThere are numerous little tweaks to improve your experience. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-help/\">Check out out</a>!\r\n\r\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\r\n\r\nThings I'm considering:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Restricting individual documents to users with a certain level of access</li>\r\n<li>Multiple sync sources</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?",

For Mountain View’s Dogcatcher, the result is a mellow, subtly-intense blend of soul, jazz, folk and indie-rock. Their first album, KILR, was a quiet folk-oriented solo album Heine wrote while living in San Diego and digesting the Iraq War he’d recently returned from. After KILR, Heine returned to his hometown, Mountain View, and formed a proper group, plucking musicians out of totally different bands to create an eclectic, genre-defying sound. On Dogcatcher’s second album, It’s Easy, the four members demonstrate that they have truly come into their own. Heine’s soft, hushed voice and simple-stated lyrics compliment the easy, hip-shaking nature of the music. But for listeners looking for lyrics with depth, Heine will not disappoint. Rather than aim for overt expressions of emotion, Heine always goes for the understated, which makes the emotionality behind the music that much more powerful with repeat listens. \r\n\r\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbI_KdDK8-c?rel=0&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]\r\n<strong>Wave Array </strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://wavearraymusic.com/\">wavearraymusic.com</a>\r\n9:20\r\nWave Array is a four-piece rock band hailing from the East Bay/San Francisco, CA that is stretching the limits of alternative/indie rock into the psychedelic and experimental realms. Using vibrant guitar and bass work, driving rhythms, and palpable melodies, the quartet aims to resonate frequencies of human emotion and thought buried beneath the preoccupation of everyday life. Wave Array's eclectic compositions of melodic vamps and hard hitting jams have already sparked the interest of the Bay Area music community as well as local and nation-wide radio. Their self-produced debut album, Cheapjack Moon, is available on iTunes and Amazon.",
