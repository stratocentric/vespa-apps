# Vespa sample applications - album recommendations

Refer to the [Quick Start](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/getting-started) to try this sample application.

<p>
This application ranks music albums using a user profile:
Albums with scores for a set of categories are matched with a user's preference.
</p>

<p>
<strong>User profile</strong>
<pre>
{
  { cat:pop  }: 0.8,
  { cat:rock }: 0.2,
  { cat:jazz }: 0.1
}
</pre>
<strong>Albums</strong>
<pre>
{
  "fields": {
    "album": "A Head Full of Dreams",
    "artist": "Coldplay",
    "year": 2015,
    "category_scores": {
      "cells": [
        { "address": { "cat": "pop"},  "value": 1  },
        { "address": { "cat": "rock"}, "value": 0.2},
        { "address": { "cat": "jazz"}, "value": 0  }
      ]
    }
  }
}

{
  "fields": {
    "album": "Love Is Here To Stay",
    "artist": "Diana Krall",
    "year": 2018,
    "category_scores": {
      "cells": [
        { "address": { "cat": "pop" },  "value": 0.4 },
        { "address": { "cat": "rock" }, "value": 0   },
        { "address": { "cat": "jazz" }, "value": 0.8 }
      ]
    }
  }
}

{
  "fields": {
    "album": "Hardwired...To Self-Destruct",
    "artist": "Metallica",
    "year": 2016,
    "category_scores": {
      "cells": [
        { "address": { "cat": "pop" },  "value": 0 },
        { "address": { "cat": "rock" }, "value": 1 },
        { "address": { "cat": "jazz" }, "value": 0 }
      ]
    }
  }

<strong>Rank profile</strong>
</p><p>
A <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/ranking.html">rank profile</a>
calculates a <em>relevance score</em> per document.
This is defined by the application author - in this case, it is the tensor product.
The data above is represented using <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tensor-user-guide.html">tensors</a>.
As the tensor is one-dimensional (the <em>cat</em> dimension), this a vector,
hence this is the dot product of the user profile and album categories:
<pre>
rank-profile rank_albums inherits default {
    first-phase {
        expression: sum(query(user_profile) * attribute(category_scores))
    }
}
</pre>
Hence, the expected scores are:
<table class="table">
<tr><th>Album</th>                                   <th>pop</th>     <th>rock</th>    <th>jazz</th>      <th>total</th></tr>
<tr><td>A Head Full of Dreams</td>         <td>0.8*1.0</td><td>0.2*0.2</td><td>0.1*0.0</td><td>0.84</td></tr>
<tr><td>Love Is Here To Stay</td>            <td>0.8*0.4</td><td>0.2*0.0</td><td>0.1*0.8</td><td>0.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hardwired...To Self-Destruct</td><td>0.8*0.0</td><td>0.2*1.0</td><td>0.1*0.0</td><td>0.2</td></tr>
</table>
Build and test the application, and validate that the document's <em>relevance</em> (i.e. score) is the expected value,
and the results are returned in descending relevance order.
