# Vespa sample application - Open-Domain Question Answering

This sample application demonstrates how to build an open domain
retrieval-based question-answering **serving** system using Vespa.  This
application implements the [Dense Passage Retriever](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR)
system, and demonstrates:

* Term-based (sparse) retrieval using BM25.
* Semantic similarity (dense) using fast approximate nearest-neighbors search based on HNSW indexes.
* BERT-based models for text encoding and answer extraction.
* Custom Java components for glue all the parts together.

For more details, refer to the companion blog post:
[Efficient open-domain question-answering on Vespa](https://blog.vespa.ai/efficient-open-domain-question-answering-on-vespa/).
This README contains the following:

- [A quick start](#quick-start) on how to test the sample application on a small data set
- Instructions on [how to feed the entire Wikipedia dataset](#how-to-feed-the-entire-dataset)
- [Experiments](#experiments) and [results](#results)
- [Implementation details](#implementation-details)

## Quick start

The following is a recipe on how to get started with a tiny set of sample data.
The sample data only contains the first 100 passages of the full dataset, but
this should be able to run on for instance a laptop. For the full dataset to
recreate the results in the DPR paper, see the next section.

Requirements:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running. 10Gb available memory for Docker is recommended.
* Git client to checkout the sample application repository
* Java 11, Maven and python3 installed
* Operating system: macOS or Linux, Architecture: x86_64

See also [Vespa quick start guide](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/vespa-quick-start.html).

First, we retrieve the sample app:

<pre data-test="exec">
$ git clone https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps.git
$ SAMPLE_APP=`pwd`/sample-apps/dense-passage-retrieval-with-ann
$ cd $SAMPLE_APP
</pre>

Download and setup the Transformer models, and build the application package.
This can take some time as the BERT-based models are around 400Mb each.

<pre data-test="exec">
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 ./bin/export-reader-model.py src/main/application/files/reader.onnx
$ python3 ./bin/export-query-model.py src/main/application/files/question_encoder.onnx
$ mvn clean package
</pre>

Start the Vespa docker container:

<pre data-test="exec">
$ docker pull vespaengine/vespa
$ docker run --detach --name vespa --hostname vespa-container --privileged \
  --volume $SAMPLE_APP:/DPR --publish 8080:8080 vespaengine/vespa
</pre>

Wait for configuration service to start (the command below should return a 200 OK):

<pre data-test="exec" data-test-wait-for="200 OK">
$ docker exec vespa bash -c 'curl -s --head http://localhost:19071/ApplicationStatus'
</pre>

Deploy the application package:

<pre data-test="exec">
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-deploy prepare /DPR/target/application.zip && \
  /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-deploy activate'
</pre>

Now, wait for the application to start. This is a fairly large application, so
this could easily take a couple of minutes on a laptop.

<pre data-test="exec" data-test-wait-for="200 OK">
$ curl -s --head http://localhost:8080/ApplicationStatus
</pre>

Feed sample data. We feed the documents using the [Vespa http feeder
client](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/vespa-http-client.html):

<pre data-test="exec">
$ docker exec vespa bash -c 'java -jar /opt/vespa/lib/jars/vespa-http-client-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --file /DPR/sample-feed.jsonl --host localhost --port 8080'
</pre>

Now we can test the application. You can enter these queries directly into the
browser or from the command line:

<pre data-test="exec" data-test-assert-contains='prediction": "2, 700"'>
$ curl -s "http://localhost:8080/search/?query=what+is+the+population+of+achill+island%3F" | python -m json.tool
</pre>

<pre data-test="exec" data-test-assert-contains='prediction": "78. 29'>
$ curl -s "http://localhost:8080/search/?query=what+is+the+boiling+point+of+ethanol%3F" | python -m json.tool
</pre>

After you are done, shutdown and remove the container:

<pre data-test="after">
$ docker rm -f vespa
</pre>


## How to feed the entire dataset

To run the full dataset, you need minimum **128GB** system memory, unless you
are running on multiple content nodes, but that is not demonstrated here. To
recreate the Exact Match score, you also need to increase the size of the input
token sequence in the [wiki document schema](src/main/application/schemas/wiki.sd#L80)
to 380.

We get the evaluation scripts and data from the DPR repository:

<pre>
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR.git
$ cd DPR; pip3 install .
</pre>

Thanks to [Facebook Research](https://opensource.fb.com/) for providing both
the pre-tokenized Wikipedia text passages and the corresponding passage
embeddings.  Note that the data is large, the text passage representation
(data.wikipedia_split) is 13G and the pre-computed embeddings are 62G.

To download the pre-generated Wikipedia snippets and the pre-computed passage
embeddings use the DPR download utility:

<pre>
$ python3 data/download_data.py  --resource data.wikipedia_split
$ python3 data/download_data.py  --resource data.retriever_results.nq.single.wikipedia_passages
</pre>

We join this data and create a Vespa feed file with one Vespa put document
operation per line [Vespa json feed
format](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/document-json-format.html).
The scripts reads the entire Wikipedia passage into memory and reads one
embedding file at a time and emits a join of the textual passage meta data with
the precomputed DPR embedding.

<pre>
$ cd ..
$ python3 ./bin/make-vespa-feed.py DPR/data/wikipedia_split/psgs_w100.tsv \
    DPR/data/retriever_results/nq/single/wikipedia_passages_* > feed.jsonl
</pre>

This will data like the following (newline formatted for readability):

<pre>
{
  "put": "id:wiki:wiki::41",
  "fields": {
    "title": "Alcohol",
    "text": "Alcohol In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which the hydroxyl functional group is bound to a carbon. ...",
    "id": 41,
    "text_embedding": {"values": [0.030272305011749268, ...]}
  }
}
</pre>

We are now ready to index the data in our Vespa installation. The feed file is 273G uncompressed.
We feed the documents as we did above:

<pre>
$ java -jar vespa-http-client-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --file feed.jsonl --endpoint http://your-vespa-instance-hostname:8080
</pre>

We can obtain the feeding client jar from the Docker image by:

<pre>
docker cp vespa:/opt/vespa/lib/jars/vespa-http-client-jar-with-dependencies.jar .
</pre>

Note that this is a large batch of data to feed. To give some idea, loading the
data to Vespa using a single content node instance with 36 vcpu's takes about 5
hours (21M passages , 1350 puts/s sustained, with visibility-delay 1.0 seconds
and real time indexing). However, note that indexing builds both the inverted
indexes for efficient sparse term based retrieval and HNSW graph for fast
efficient dense embedding retrieval.

## Experiments

With the full dataset indexed in Vespa, we can now run all questions from the
Natural Questions (NQ) dev split using the three different retrieval strategies:

<pre>
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions/master/nq_open/NQ-open.dev.jsonl
$ python3 ./bin/evaluate_em.py NQ-open.dev.jsonl dense http://your-vespa-instance-hostname:8080
$ python3 ./bin/evaluate_em.py NQ-open.dev.jsonl sparse http://your-vespa-instance-hostname:8080
$ python3 ./bin/evaluate_em.py NQ-open.dev.jsonl hybrid http://your-vespa-instance-hostname:8080
</pre>

## Results

In the following section we describe the experiments we have performed with
this setup, all experiments are done running queries via the [Vespa query
api](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-api) and and checking the
predicted answer against the golden reference answer.

<pre>
def get_vespa_result(question, retriever_model):
  request_body = {
    'type': 'any',
    'query': question,
    'retriever': retriever_model
  }
  url = endpoint + '/search/'
  response = requests.post(url, json=request_body)
  return response.json()
</pre>

### Retriever Accuracy Summary

The following table summarizes the retriever accuracy using the original 3,610
dev questions in the Natural Questions for Open Domain Question Answering tasks
([NQ-open.dev.jsonl](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions/blob/master/nq_open/NQ-open.dev.jsonl)).

We use Recall@K as the main evaluation metric for the retriever, the final top
position passages are re-ranked using the full attention Reader.

The obvious goal of the retriever is to have the highest recall possible at the
lowest possible position. The fewer passages we need to evaluate through the
BERT reader the better the run time complexity and performance is. We evaluate
three different retrieval strategies:

* **Dense** Using the DPR embeddings and Vespa's nearest neighbor search
  operator
* **Sparse** Using the Vespa's
  [weakAnd(WAND)](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/using-wand-with-vespa.html)
  query operator and using BM25(title) + BM25(text)
* **Hybrid** Using a linear combination of the above and using OR to combine
  the weakAnd and nearestNeighbor search operator.

| Retrieval Model                 | Recall@1  | Recall@5 | Recall@10| Recall@20 |
|-------------------------------- |-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| sparse (WAND bm25)              | 23.77     | 44.24    | 52.69    | 61.47     |
| dense  (nearest neighbor)       | 46.37     | 68.53    | 75.07    | 80.36     |
| hybrid (WAND + nearest neighbor)| 40.61     | 69.25    | 75.96    | 80.44     |

The DPR paper reports Recall@20 79.4 so our results are in accordance with the
reported results for the dense retrieval method.

The following table summarizes the retriever accuracy using the 1,800 dev
questions used in the [Efficient Open-Domain Question Answering
challenge](https://efficientqa.github.io/)
([NQ-open.efficientqa.dev.1.1.jsonl](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions/blob/master/nq_open/NQ-open.efficientqa.dev.1.1.jsonl)).

| Retrieval Model                 | Recall@1  | Recall@5 | Recall@10| Recall@20 |
|---------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| sparse (WAND bm25)              | 23.94     | 44.67    | 52.67    | 60.78     |
| dense  (nearest neighbor)       | 41.78     | 66.11    | 73.28    | 77.94     |
| hybrid (WAND + nearest neighbor)| 36.94     | 66.94    | 74.28    | 78.06     |

To our knowledge there are no Retrieval accuracy reported yet for the
*NQ-open.efficientqa.dev.1.1.jsonl*.

### Reader Accuracy Summary

We evaluate the Reader accuracy using the Exact Match (EM) metric. We report EM
metrics for Reader re-ranking using top 5, top 10, and top 100 passages from
the retriever phase. The Exact Match metric measures the percentage of
predictions that match any one of the ground truth answers **exactly**.  To get
an EM score of 1 for a query the answer prediction must match exactly the
golden answer given in the dataset. For instance for the question *when was the
last moon landing* and the predicted answer *14 December 1972* it will not
match the golden answers which are *14 December 1972 UTC* or *December 1972*.

**Original Natural Question dev set**
([NQ-open.dev.jsonl](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions/blob/master/nq_open/NQ-open.dev.jsonl))

| Retrieval Model                 | EM(@5)    | EM (@10)|
|---------------------------------|-----------|--------|
| sparse (WAND bm25               | 23.80     | 26.23  |
| dense  (nearest neighbor)       | 39.34     | 40.58  |
| hybrid (WAND + nearest neighbor)| 39.36     | 40.61  |

**EfficientQA Natural Question dev set**
([NQ-open.efficientqa.dev.1.1.jsonl](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions/blob/master/nq_open/NQ-open.efficientqa.dev.1.1.jsonl))

| Retrieval Model                 | EM(@5)   | EM (@10)|
|---------------------------------|-----------|--------|
| sparse (WAND bm25               | 21.22     | 24.72  |
| dense  (nearest neighbor)       | 35.17     | 35.89  |
| hybrid (WAND + nearest neighbor)| 35.22     | 35.94  |


## Implementation details

We take the DPR implementation, which is a set of python tools and models, and
convert the models to Vespa.ai for online serving while maintaining the same or
better accuracy as reported in the DPR paper.

* We index text passages from the English version of the Wikipedia along with
  their embedding representation produced by the DPR document encoder in a
  Vespa.ai instance. Representing DPR on Vespa.ai also allow researchers to
  experiment with different retrieval strategies.
* We use the pre-trained DPR BERT based query embedding model from
  [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/dpr.html) which
  we export to [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format using Huggingface's [Transformer
  model export support](https://huggingface.co/transformers/serialization.html)
  and we import this ONNX model to Vespa for serving so that given a textual
  query input we can convert it into the embedding representation at user time.
* The DPR query embedding representation is used as input to Vespa.ai's [fast
  approximate nearest neighbor
  search](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html) which
  enables fast computing the top-k matching passages in the embedding space.
* The top-k retrieved passages (Using multiple different retrieval strategies)
  are re-ranked using Vespa's support for multi-tier retrieval and ranking with
  another BERT based model which scores passages and computes the most likely
  answer span from the passages.
* We use Vespa's plugin support to implement a sub-word BERT tokenizer.
* We reproduce the state-of-the-art retrieval metrics and reader evaluation
  metrics as reported in the paper using the Open Domain variant of the Natural
  Questions.

Using Vespa.ai as serving engine for passage retrieval for question answering
allows representing both sparse term based and dense embedding retrieval in the
same schema, which also enables hybrid retrieval using a combination of the two
approaches. With Vespa's support for running Transformer based models like BERT
via Vespa's ONNX Runtime support we are also able to deploy the DPR BERT query
embedding encoder used for the dense embedding retrieval in the same serving
system and also the DPR BERT based Reader component which re-scores the
retrieved passages and predicts the best answer span.

### Schema

We represent the Wikipedia passage text, title and the passage embedding vector
in the same Vespa [document schema](src/main/application/schemas/wiki.sd).  We
also store the token ids from the BERT tokenization as Vespa tensor fields.
These token_ids fields are not used by the retriever component but by the
reader. The tensor field type in Vespa is always stored in memory for fast
access during retrieval and ranking. The schema is defined below:

<pre>
schema wiki {

  document wiki {

    field title type string {
      indexing: summary | index
      index: enable-bm25
    }

    field title_token_ids type tensor<float>(d0[256]) {
        indexing: summary | attribute
    }

    field text type string {
      indexing: summary | index
      index: enable-bm25
    }

    field text_token_ids type tensor<float>(d0[256]) {
      indexing: summary |attribute
    }

    field id type long {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }

    field text_embedding type tensor<float>(x[769]){
      indexing: attribute | index
      attribute {
        distance-metric:euclidean
      }
      index {
        hnsw {
          max-links-per-node: 32
          neighbors-to-explore-at-insert: 500
        }
      }
    }
  }
  fieldset default {
    fields: title, text
  }
}
</pre>

The above Vespa document schema allows retrieval using different strategies
using the same scalable serving engine:

* **Sparse retrieval** Using traditional term based (High dimensional, sparse)
* **Dense retrieval** Using trained embedding representations of query and document (Low dimensional, dense)
* **Hybrid** Using a combination of the above

The schema defines 2 string fields which are indexed which enables fast and
efficient term based retrieval, e.g using WeakAND (WAND).  The *id* represents
the Wikipedia passage id as assigned in the pre-computed dataset published by
Facebook Research.  The *text_embedding* tensor is a dense 769 dimensional
tensor which represents the document (text and title) and we enable [HNSW index
for fast approximate nearest neighbor
search](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html).

The dual query and document encoder of the DPR retrieval system uses the inner
dot product between the query tensor and the document tensor to represent the
score.  We transform the 768 dimensional inner product space to euclidean space
using an [euclidean
transformation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/XboxInnerProduct.pdf)
which adds one dimension so our representation becomes 769 dimensional where we
can use the euclidean distance metric when finding the nearest neighbors in
embedding space.  The DPR implementation uses the same space transformation
when using [Faiss with HNSW index](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).


### Retrieval and ranking

We can express our retrieval strategies by

* A Vespa [search api
  request](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-api.html) with a query
  specified using the [Vespa YQL query
  language](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/query-language-reference.html)
  or we can build the query request programatically in a custom Searcher plugin
  written in Java. In this sample application we build the query retrieval
  trees using the latter approach.
* A [ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/ranking.html) specification
  which controls how we score documents retrieved by the query.

Vespa assigns rank score using ranking expressions, configured in a ranking
profile in the document schema. The rank profile can also specify [multi-phased
ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html). Choosing
rank profile is a run time request parameter (ranking.profile).

The ranking profile is also configured in the schema and our question answering
ranking profile looks like this

<pre>
onnx-model reader {
  file: files/reader.onnx
  input  input_ids: input_ids
  input  attention_mask: attention_mask
  output output_0: start_logits
  output output_1: end_logits
  output output_2: relevance_logits
}

rank-profile openqa {
  function input_ids() {
    expression {
      tensor<float>(d0[1],d1[380])(...)
    }
  }

  function attention_mask() {
    expression: map(input_ids, f(a)(a > 0))
  }

  first-phase {
    expression: closeness(field, text_embedding)
  }

  second-phase {
    rerank-count: 10
    expression: onnxModel(reader).relevance_logits
  }

  summary-features {
    onnxModel(reader).start_logits
    onnxModel(reader).end_logits
    input_ids # The input sequence with special tokens (CLS/SEP)
  }
}
</pre>

The *input_ids* function builds the input tensor to the ONNX model. The batch
size is 1 and the max sequence length is 380 token _ids, including special
tokens like CLS and SEP. The function builds a tensor: [[CLS, question
token_ids, SEP, title_token_ids, SEP, text_token_ids]] which is evaluated by
the Reader ONNX model. The **summary-features** is a way to pass ranking
features and tensors from the content nodes to the java serving container.

### Importing Transformer models to Vespa.ai via ONNX

The DPR team has published the pre-trained checkpoints on
[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models)' model repository :

* BERT based question encoder https://huggingface.co/facebook/dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base
* BERT based document encoder https://huggingface.co/facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base
* BERT based reader https://huggingface.co/facebook/dpr-reader-single-nq-base

We can export these Transformer models to [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format using
Huggingface's [Transformer model export
support](https://huggingface.co/transformers/serialization.html):

* DPR Question encoder model [bin/export-query-model.py](bin/export-query-model.py)
* DPR Reader model [bin/export-reader-model.py](bin/export-reader-model.py)

In the following snippet we export the reader model to ONNX format and
serialize it to *reader.onnx*.

<pre>
import onnx
import transformers
import transformers.convert_graph_to_onnx as onnx_convert

from pathlib import Path

tokenizer = transformers.DPRReaderTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/dpr-reader-single-nq-base')
model = transformers.DPRReader.from_pretrained('facebook/dpr-reader-single-nq-base', return_dict=True)
pipeline = transformers.Pipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

onnx_convert.convert_pytorch(pipeline, opset=11, output=Path("files/reader.onnx"), use_external_format=False)
</pre>

We store these ONNX models in the application package, for instance as
"files/reader.onnx", and we set up the model for use in the `onnx-model`
section in the schema. We can then reference this model as
`onnxModel(reader).relevance_logits` in the ranking expression. Vespa takes
care of distributing the model to the content nodes in the cluster.


### Vespa Container Middleware - putting it all together

The application has 4 custom plugins:

* A BERT Tokenizer component which does map text to BERT vocabulary token_ids.
  This is a shared component which both the custom Searcher and Document
  processor uses. We store the token_ids of the text and the title in the
  document so we don't need to perform any run time tokenization.
* A custom Document Processor which does BERT tokenization during indexing.
  [QADocumentProcessor.java](src/main/java/ai/vespa/processor/QADocumentProcessor.java)
* A custom Searcher which controls the Retrieval logic (Sparse, dense, hybrid)
  and uses the BERT Tokenizer to convert the question string to a sequence of
  token_ids.
  [RetrieveModelSearcher.java](src/main/java/ai/vespa/searcher/RetrieveModelSearcher.java)
* A custom Searcher which reads the outputs of the reader model for the best
  ranking hit from the reader phase (Vespa second phase ranking) and maps the
  best matching answer span to an textual answer which is returned as the
  predicted answer.
  [QASearcher.java](src/main/java/ai/vespa/searcher/QASearcher.java)
